# Movie Recommendation System with Content-Based Filtering




## Overview
This GitHub repository contains a movie recommendation system implemented using machine learning with content-based filtering. Content-based filtering recommends items based on the features of the items and the preferences of the user. In this case, the system recommends movies to users based on the content/features of the movies they have liked or interacted with.
## Features

- Content-Based Filtering: The recommendation system uses the content of the movies, such as genres, keywords, and other relevant features, to make personalized recommendations for users.
- Movie Database: The system utilizes a comprehensive movie database to gather information about various movies.
- User Interactions: Users can input their preferences, such as liked movies, and the system will provide recommendations based on those preferences.
